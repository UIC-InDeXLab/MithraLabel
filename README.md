## Abstract
Using inappropriate datasets for data science tasks can be harmful, especially for applications that impact humans. Targeting data ethics, we demonstrate MithraLabel, a system for generating task-specific information about a dataset, in the form of a set of visual widgets, as a flexible "nutritional label" that provides a user with information to determine the fitness of the dataset for the task at hand.
